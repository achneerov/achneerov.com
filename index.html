                        As a cybersecurity professional and Computer Science student at Concordia University, I specialize in cryptography, network security, and leveraging AI/ML technologies to enhance security. With hands-on experience as a Tier 1 Security Analyst intern at Foodtastic Inc., Iâ€™ve successfully led phishing campaigns, implemented security solutions like Microsoft Intune and Multi-Factor Authentication, and designed automated systems to optimize operations. My technical skills, coupled with a strong eagerness to learn and problem-solving abilities, allow me to deliver impactful solutions. I'm also actively involved in coding competitions, hackathons, and leadership within the Computer Science Society.
